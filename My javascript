1 | Create a JavaScript file
In your project, in the same folder as your index.html page, create a new file called my-project.js. All of your project’s JavaScript code should be written in .js files.
2 | Add some test code to the file
In your new file my-project.js, add the code below:
console.log('It works!');
This code will show the message “It works!” in your browser’s developer output window, which we will look at soon.
3 | Add the file to your web page
In your index.html file, add a script tag to load your new JavaScript. The script tag should be the last line of code before your closing body tag.
This is the line you need to add:
<script src="my-project.js"></script>
And this is an example HTML file including the new line:
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my Example Page</h1>
        <p>This is some page content.</p>
        <script src="my-project.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
4 | Save your files
Make sure you have saved all your files, especially your new my-project.js and your changes to index.html.
5 | Open the web page in Google Chrome
In your normal operating system’s folder browser, find your index.html file. Right click the file and choose “Open with Google Chrome”.
6 | Open the Developer Console
In Chrome, click on the options menu at the top right, which looks like three little dots. Go to More Tools then click Developer Tools.
In the developer tools, click on the tab called Console and you should see your message “It works!”
If you do not see the message, you will need to double-check that you have followed the steps correctly.
Quick Recap
Here’s all the steps in a simplified form:
Create a new JavaScript file with some console.log() test code.
Load the JavaScript file using a script tag in your HTML.
Use the Developer Tools to check that the message shows up.
Once the test message is showing up successfully, you can add any other JavaScript code you want to the file.
Common problems
If your message is not showing up, check the following:
There are no mistakes in your JavaScript code.
There are no mistakes in your HTML code.
You have both an opening <script> and a closing </script> tag.
Script tags have been added to every HTML page where you want the JavaScript to be included (we only added it to index.html).
The file name my-project.js is spelled exactly the same in both the HTML and the actual file name. Capital letters matter!
You have definitely saved all your files.
